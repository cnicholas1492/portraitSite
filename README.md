#portraitSite
For my CodeKentucky project, I've chosen to create a mock website to display my portrait sketches, sell prints, and accept commission requests.

I've satisfied the requirements by adding the following to my project:

> Two "mobile first" media queries: 

1) Changes the layout of the navigation menu in the header from a standard layout to an interactive "hamburger" menu with a couple animations when the screen size reaches a typical mobile device width (768px).
2)

> Items on the CSS Features List:

1) Navigation menu that expands and collapses at desktop and mobile sizes, and switches to a "hamburger" icon.
2) CSS Grid to organize the main content, so the row/column layout changes as the screen changes size.
3) Used ":nth-child" in the mobile media query to style the "hamburger" menu: switches to an "X" when clicked to open, and returns to the regular style when clicked to close.

>Items on the JavaScript Features List:
1) A "Contact" form that validates an email address, and informs the user of the error if typed incorrectly.
2) Show/hide the navigation menu in the header by clicking the "hamburger" icon.
